5 paragraphs: [('wikipedia', 'anarchism is political philosophy and movement that rejects all involuntary coercive forms of hierarchy it calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful it is usually described alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing libertarian socialism of the socialist movement and as having historical association with anti capitalism and socialism the history of anarchism goes back to prehistory when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states realms or empires with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies skepticism toward authority also rose but it was not until the th century that self conscious political movement emerged during the latter half of the th and the first decades of the th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had significant role in workers struggles for emancipation various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism in the last decades of the th century and into the st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state and have taken violent turn in the past evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like anarchist thought criticism and praxis have played part in diverse areas of human society criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent violent and utopian etymology terminology and definition the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without ruler composed of the prefix an without and the word arkhos leader or ruler the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the th century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but they did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid th century since the and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently hence it might be true to say that anarchism is cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization including the state capitalism nationalism and all associated institutions in the conduct of all human relations in favour of society based on voluntary association on freedom and on but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology which is simply negation of ruler or based on anti statism anarchism is much more than that or even the anti authoritarian which is an posteriori conclusion nonetheless major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following the will for non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such non coercive society suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy history pre modern era zeno of citium bc whose republic inspired peter kropotkin during the prehistoric era of mankind an established authority did not exist it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as reaction most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness cynics dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of state during the middle ages there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the muslim world or in christian europe this kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies libertarian ideas further emerged during the renaissance with the spread of reasoning and humanism through europe novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism the enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress modern era during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enragés and the saw turning point in the fermentation of anti state and federalist sentiments the first anarchist currents developed throughout the th century william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimizing the state max stirner thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhon theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war of and is considered the golden age of anarchism anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmen association class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents the international became significant political force with karl marx being leading figure and member of its general council bakunin faction the jura federation and proudhon followers the mutualists opposed marxist state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marx terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers after being expelled anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one needs at the turn of the century anarchism had spread all over the world in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism tokyo was hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east travelling to the japanese capital to study in latin america argentina was stronghold for anarcho syndicalism where it became the most prominent left wing ideology during this time minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated in the russian revolution despite concerns in opposition to the whites however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilized several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhno struggle in the free territory with the anarchists being crushed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism the former sought to create coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble political party seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international in the spanish civil war anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing pivotal role in the war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was bitter fight among communists and anarchists at series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans post war era rojava supports efforts for workers to form cooperatives such as this sewing cooperative at the end of world war ii the anarchist movement was severely weakened however the witnessed revival of anarchism likely caused by perceived failure of marxism leninism and tensions built by the cold war during this time anarchism took root in other movements critical towards both the state and capitalism such as the anti nuclear environmental and pacifist movements the new left and the counterculture of the anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols and the established feminist tendencies of anarcha feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization the group of eight and the world economic forum during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at the wto conference in seattle in anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava de facto autonomous region in northern syria thought anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership in chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late th century and the post classical currents such as anarcha feminism green anarchism and post anarchism developed thereafter beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of minimal state but argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have central role in anarchist philosophy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but as tendencies that intermingle anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian anti statist and libertarian interpretations of the radical left wing and socialist politics of collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories as anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely classical pierre joseph proudhon the primary proponent of anarcho mutualism who influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist communist and syndicalist they differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society mutualism is an th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre joseph proudhon its aims include reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform that would be regulated by bank of the people mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property collectivist anarchism also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho collectivism is revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarcho communism also known as anarchist communism communist anarchism and libertarian communism is theory of anarchism that advocates communist society with common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need anarcho communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin anarcho syndicalism also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism is branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau through many countries individualist anarchism attracted small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation post classical and contemporary lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors with zerzan being prominent voice within anarcho primitivism and jarach noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalization movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled revival of interest contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism historical association with chaos and violence although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches the anti capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core as result commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently for example gender equality can be common principle but ranks as higher priority to anarcha feminists than anarchist communists anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems capitalism bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions fundamentalist islam roman catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism however anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed tactics anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals first to oppose the establishment and second to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means and aims to change society through evolutionary means evolutionary tactics reject violence and take gradual approach to anarchist aims though there is significant overlap between the two anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century anarchists during the early th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use broader array of approaches classical era tactics the relationship between anarchism and violence is controversial subject among anarchists pictured is leon czolgosz assassinating president william mckinley during the classical era anarchists had militant tendency not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful anarchists also took part in revolutions anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial on one hand anarcho pacifists point out the unity of means and ends on the other hand other anarchist groups advocate direct action tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism this attitude was quite prominent century ago seeing the state as tyrant some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence argued that violence is merely reaction to state violence as necessary evil anarchists took an active role in strikes although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist they saw it as part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced nudism they also built communities which were based on friendship they were also involved in the press revolutionary tactics in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included overall today anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries like canada mexico or greece μilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking anti fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening evolutionary tactics anarchists commonly employ direct action this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counter institutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives often decision making is handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism contemporary era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations the newly coined term small anarchism in contrast with the big anarchism of the classical era signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical era anarchism or to refer to kropotkin or proudhon to justify their opinions they would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize the decision making process of small affinity anarchist groups play significant tactical role anarchists have employed various methods in order to build rough consensus among members of their group without the need of leader or leading group one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting specific point minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals values or ethics anarchists usually form small groups individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members these kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by syndicate anarchists have gone online to spread their message as in the past newspapers and journals are used however because of distributional and other difficulties anarchists have found it easier to create websites hosting electronic libraries and other portals anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz spaces where surrealism poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal as seen by anarchists squatting is way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and is also seen an exemplary direct action acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds adding up these tactics and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity key issues as anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory for instance the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others gender sexuality and free love french individualist anarchist émile armand propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy anarchism is obliged to address analyse and oppose the suppression of one autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism this current survives as tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men the notion of free love though was much broader it included critique of the established order that limited women sexual freedom and pleasure such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together free love had roots both in europe and the united states some anarchists however struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage were pro choice utilizing contemporary term and had likewise agenda anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were nonetheless supportive of one another during the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well by the latest decades of the th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalized groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting fusion of the two currents with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became subject of study for anarchists which yielded post structuralist critique of sexual normality however some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was therefore dropping the cause of social liberation anarchism and education anarchist vs statist perspectives on educationruth kinna anarchist education state education concept education as self mastery education as service management community based state run methods practice based learning vocational training aims being critical member of society being productive member of society the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism anarchists consider proper education which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid anarchist writers such as willian godwin and max stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church ferrer approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested his ideas however formed the inspiration for series of modern schools around the world christian anarchist leo tolstoy also established similar school with its founding principle according to tolstoy being that for education to be effective it had to be free in similar token neill founding what became summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion anarchist education is based largely on the idea that child right to develop freely without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer for example believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of nationalism and government late th century and contemporary anarchist writers such as colin ward herbert read and paul goodman intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for system that focuses on children creativity rather than on their ability to attain career or participate in consumer society contemporary anarchists such as colin ward have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socio economic inequality while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day major tenets of anarchist schools such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society anarchism and art les chataigniers osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro th century neo impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism in this specific painting note how the blending of aestetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others while in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo romanticism movement in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read argued that the border between the artist and the non artist what separates art from daily act is construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living joyful life other anarchists advocated for or used art as means to achieve anarchist ends in his book breaking the spell history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris robé claims that anarchist inflected practices have increasingly structured movement based video activism throughout the th century many prominent anarchists such as peter kropotkin emma goldman gustav landauer and camillo berneri and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict critique of existing society and hierarchies it could serve as prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and also it could turn into means of direct action in protests for example as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have powerful effect criticism the most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and state is necessary for human survival philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique noting that peace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in community in which there was no central government philosophy lecturer andrew fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism fiala other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world at protests but in the world of ethics as well secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it the third argument is that anarchism is self contradictory since while it advocates for no one to archiei if accepted by the many then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory in this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken lastly fiala mentions critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro anarchist books such as john simmons moral principles and political obligations law professor william edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe normal state duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate academic john molyneux notes in his book anarchism marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas notable political critics of anarchism include vladimir lenin who wrote in that it produced general platitudes against exploitation but that anarchism lacked understanding of the causes of exploitation the development of society and class struggle see also anarchism by country governance without government list of anarchist political ideologies list of books about anarchism

difficulties with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at normal pace autism is associated with combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypothesis which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm combines autism and less severe forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who recovered some autistic adults are unable to live independently an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking cure and others believing autism should be accepted as difference to be accommodated instead of cured globally autism is estimated to affect million people in the the number of people affected was estimated at per people worldwide in the developed countries about of children are diagnosed with asd from in in the united states it occurs four to five times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism is highly variable disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood and generally follows steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with typical neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to lower ability to define person own emotions children with high functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns communication about third to half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in specific order checking things or hand washing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with single television program toy or game self injury behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated to of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur there is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism these are linked to greater social impairment irritability behavior and sleep problems language impairments and mood changes parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur deletion duplication and inversion are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for asd and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to mendelian single gene mutation or to single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily male condition but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd in both term and preterm infants maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating genetic problem or damaging the nervous system exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple there is evidence that gut brain axis abnormalities may be involved review proposed that immune dysregulation inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain and dysfunction review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi is semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used pediatrician commonly performs preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions pediatric is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile testing genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than three year old to continue to do so few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits girls are often diagnosed later than boys underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to loss of language or social skills as opposed to failure to make progress typically from to months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is specific subtype or that there is continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior spectrum autism has long been thought to cover wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds some people have called for an end to the terms high functioning and low functioning due to lack of nuance and the potential for person needs or abilities to be overlooked screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no response to name or eye to eye gaze by months no babbling by months no gesturing pointing waving etc by months no single words by months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by months loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventive services task force in found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at and months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged months suggests that it is best used in clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features prevention while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment services should be carried out by behavior analysts special education teachers speech pathologists and licensed psychologists studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care communication and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns education educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on specific area of deficit the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention eibi treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children is currently low and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as probable efficacious mode of treatment early intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children it is also well established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes more naturalistic form of aba combined with developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in gap between what report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails they may also be used for associated health problems such as adhd or anxiety more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda approved for treating associated aggressive and self injurious behaviors however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically side effects for example may include weight gain tiredness drooling and aggression ssri antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance some alternative treatments may place the child at risk the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein free diets as consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin however suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and disorders in botched chelation therapy killed five year old child with autism chelation is not recommended for people with asd since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism as of there is no good evidence to recommend gluten and casein free diet as standard treatment review concluded that it may be therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or allergies or with food intolerance markers the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and casein free diet in children with asd in total all of them compared gluten and casein free diet versus normal diet with control group double blind randomized controlled trials double blind crossover trial single blind trial in two of the studies whose duration was and months significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate was identified in the other two studies whose duration was months no significant effect was observed the authors concluded that longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of placebo effect in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors results of systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness based interventions for improving mental health this includes decreasing stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and non verbal communication skills there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects prognosis there is no known cure the degree of symptoms can decrease occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from to most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though few have developed communication skills in later years many children with autism lack social support future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above and having marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had job about half of people in their with autism are not employed epidemiology reports of autism cases per children grew dramatically in the us from to it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate prevalence of per for autism and close to per for asd as of survey in the united states reported rate of per children for asd globally autism affects an estimated million people while asperger syndrome affects further million in the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged years and over in the uk was rates of pdd nos has been estimated at per asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per cdc estimates about out of for an increase from out of every children for the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the and early this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism true prevalence has increased real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from to wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from to many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history portrait of victor of aveyron feral child caught in who displayed possible symptoms of autism few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of year old boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair marriage to gain blair inheritance the wild boy of aveyron feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance soviet child psychiatrist grunya sukhareva described similar syndrome that was published in russian in and in german in clinical development and diagnoses leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in the word autism first took its modern sense in when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler terminology autistic psychopaths in lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as separate diagnosis until leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in report of children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in and was labeled as case triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on piano and to mentally multiply numbers his father oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and president pictures by the age of he had the ability to recite the rd psalm and memorized questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism he was also interested in creating musical chords kanner reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late autism was established as separate syndrome terminology and distinction from schizophrenia as late as the mid there was little evidence of genetic role in autism while in it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until for the dsm iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in the dsm iii provided checklist for diagnosing autism in may the dsm was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pdd nos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with and has given them way to form online communities and work remotely societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being society and culture autism awareness ribbon an autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements events include world autism awareness day autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include autistic self advocacy network aspies for freedom autism national committee and autism society of america at the same time some organizations including autism speaks have been condemned by disability rights organizations for failing to support autistic people social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements while most autistic individuals do not have savant skills many have been successful in their fields autism rights movement the autism rights movement is social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as result of natural variations in the human brain rather than disorder to be cured the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as minority group autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as natural expression of the human genome this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views the medical perspective that autism is caused by genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are high functioning or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of low functioning autistic people employment about half of autistics are unemployed and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed among autistics who find work most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children see also personality disorder child behavior checklist developmental systems theory child development stages references external links'), ('wikipedia', 'diffusely reflected sunlight relative to various surface conditions albedo meaning whiteness is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on scale from corresponding to black body that absorbs all incident radiation to corresponding to body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance flux per unit area received by surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for single angle of incidence for given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between and μm this spectrum includes visible light μm which explains why surfaces with low albedo appear dark trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with high albedo appear bright snow reflects most radiation albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria terrestrial albedo sample albedos surface typicalalbedo fresh asphalt open ocean worn asphalt conifer forest summer to deciduous forest to bare soil green grass desert sand new concrete ocean ice to fresh snow any albedo in visible light falls within range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of black body when seen from distance the ocean surface has low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for single direction by satellite not all directions mathematical model is used to translate sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo earth average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost white sky black sky and blue sky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at particular solar zenith angle can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and the bi hemispherical reflectance sometimes referred to as white sky albedo with being the proportion of direct radiation from given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface astronomical albedo the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time composes major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about typical comet nucleus has an albedo of such dark surface is thought to be indicative of primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is common source of confusion planet geometric bond mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and is the absolute magnitude examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where change in illumination induces change in the earth surface at that location through melting of reflective ice that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with local maximum in the tropics insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather albedo temperature feedback when an area albedo changes due to snowfall snow temperature feedback results layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow over antarctica snow albedo averages little more than if marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback just as fresh snow has higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of positive feedback both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying single value for albedo over broad regions small scale effects albedo works on smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon si and crystalline silicon si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications trees because forests generally have low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat as net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have value of about to variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water reflectivity of smooth water at refractive index water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from minimum of near to maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per spracklen et al the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is with range to black carbon is bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo human activities human activities deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the

earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also

american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the

on the same site in this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine civil war and reconstruction by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color on january alabama declared its secession from the union after remaining an independent republic for few

fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort union army troops occupying courthouse square in huntsville following its capture and occupation by federal forces in company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrest battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails this

emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin turner and james rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified new state constitution in which created the state first public school system and expanded women rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in after most african americans and many poor whites in the constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the th century to impose segregation in everyday life th century the developing skyline of birmingham in the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring poll tax and literacy test the constitution required racial segregation of public schools by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their as well due mostly to the imposition of cumulative poll tax by whites constituted slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs african americans nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city by birmingham was the th largest city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature in the united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties in for the first time since the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been for more than sixty years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the and to end and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the supreme court ruled in brown board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the congress legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabama african americans were living in alabama cities such as birmingham and montgomery also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more

government state government state capitol building in montgomery completed in the foundational document for alabama government is the alabama constitution which was ratified in at almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama constitution critics argue that alabama constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism heflin torbert judicial building in montgomery it houses the supreme court of alabama alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabama government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with members and the alabama senate with members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override gubernatorial veto by simple majority most state legislatures require two thirds majority to override veto until the state elected state senators on geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as result urbanized areas were grossly it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds sims the supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments republican kay ivey is the current governor of alabama the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the lieutenant governor of alabama the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor is republican kay ivey the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas state which has population five times larger however executions per capita are significantly higher in texas some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april taxes taxes are collected by the alabama department of revenue alabama levies or percent personal income tax depending on the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax even if taking the standard deduction those who itemize can also deduct fica the social security and medicare tax the state general sales tax rate is sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means diner in mobile would pay an tax on meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply lower tax rate alabama income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the alabama is the only state that levies income tax on family of four with income as low as which is barely one quarter the federal poverty line alabama threshold is the lowest among the states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the the current state constitution requires voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million county and local governments alabama has counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning the state government holds monopoly on the sale of alcohol the

marshall guntersville albertville lauderdale florence florence politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation after coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents process completed in provisions of the constitution provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites by more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised to the total effects were greater on the black community as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the civil rights movement when whites and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state only four term governor was controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of and voting rights act of did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable more diverse representation among county boards in the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years there are total of registered voters with active and the others inactive in the state elections doug jones won special election in state elections with the of blacks in the state became part of the solid south system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late th century however white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice ernest hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to republican perry hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom kay ivey and will ainsworth present local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabama county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is democrats republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban suburban and heavily populated counties the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african american sheriffs federal elections the state two senators are republican richard shelby and democrat doug jones shelby was originally elected to the senate as democrat in and re elected in but switched parties immediately following the november general election in the house of representatives the state is represented by
